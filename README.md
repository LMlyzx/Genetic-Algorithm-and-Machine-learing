The objective of this study is to develop a GA-based approach, utilizing a feedback linkage between feature selection and classification. That is, a GA-based method carries out feature selection and simultaneously a classifier performs a classification with the selected features. The prediction accuracy is calculated based on the performance of the classifier, and it is used as the fitness function in evolution process of GA, with higher accuracy results in higher fitness. The goal of this method is to find a reduced subset among the original features such that redundant information and noise is excluded.
